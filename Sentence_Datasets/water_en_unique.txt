the buoyancy force of the water is distributed over the whole submerged part of t the water pressure pushing on the outer surface of the boat instead they can just remember that on flat water the force of gravity is straight down and the fornd a wave or the paddler reaching for an escaped water bottle the kayak will start to tipon you are tipping the hull pushes down into the water on that side while the other side lifts out of the water above the blue line is the original even keel waterlinehe wedge shaped green volume b lifts out of the water and the other wedge of purple c sinks into the wateruoyancy happens due to changes of volume near the waterlinethis is why initial stability is dependant on the waterline shape and width and not on the shape below the waterline because it is only the water near the waterline that is initially effected by tipping it is only the shape near the waterline that effects initial stabilityow slice or wedge of volume being pushed into the water on the side of the tip and a similar slice lifti this happens along the whole water plane of the boat the water plane is just the outline of the boat at the wate a larger water plane area increases the volume moving from side  giving the water plane a greater average width has the same effect
notice that the water plane determines the shape and volume of the imagss sectional shape of the boat above or below the water plane dont have much effector example hard chine and soft chine but similar water plane shapes will have similar initial stabilityly effect the stability as it enters or exits the watere tipping angle is small parts above or below the water line dont effect the water plane much so initia
