 i did not sprinkle salt on top of the cookies the salt on top is brillianthad to try this recipe – i love the combination of salt and sweet in so many things and what i hear about
also the sea salt – is that supposed to be coarse as well  there are i don’t bother trying to sift the coarse salt with the flours i either use half the quantity with regular table salt or throw in coarse salt after sifting only use 12 tsp salt in recipe due to salt on dough before cooking – cook one pan when you mou simply leave them in ball form
