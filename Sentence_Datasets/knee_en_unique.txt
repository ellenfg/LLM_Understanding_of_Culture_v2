i would be very cautious in going into this knee to remove scar tissues he has pain in the front of his knee during running kept complaining to my doctor that the pain in my knee was in the knee cap area surgery but only to continue with the pain in my knee cappicious for hoffa’s fat pad impingement 2 small knee joint effusion 3 progressive superficial infrapest thing to do is avoid activities that make your knee pain worse and get a really experienced physiother5 years ago i injured my knee from repetitive squatting and twistingng bad pain and problems walking bicycling and my knee being swollen i tried all options to eliminate my knee pain and stiffness but had no luck in doing sod pain along the left middle and right side of my knee jointso i can be active again  what do you suggest this knee problem may be and what i may look into doing to c once the knee is warmed up the pain may become less and the runscal tears so should i have these polished on the knee that has the fat pad hyper trophy  i have had phys after working for 8hrs on my feet all day my knee is painfulreatment must be based on the actual cause of your knee painhypertrophied fat pad may not be the cause of your knee pain if the examination does not correlate with thy surgery should only be done if the cause of your knee pain is certain
meniscal tears are more likely to give you knee pain then the fat padatients and that can result in mal tracking during knee movements this can be a cause of anterior knee painr surgeon to clarify your doubts and ask if a good knee guard may be useful in the interim period before your knee becomes stronger a baurfeind genutrain p3 knee brace can sometimes be quite useful

hi dr chang
i’ve knee pain in both knees and fat pad pain in my left medpears you have lateral patellar tilt with anterior knee pain my knee makes a lot of crunching sounds when i bendsquat of the patellar tendon and worse on pressing or on knee extension when walking i have severe swelling above my knee alsohere could be fluid being held in the sac above my knee causing the excruciating pain i asked my consultacar tissues are painful when stretched or when the knee is moved after a period of inactivity
it is very difficult to get rid of your knee pain at this point in timehts on what could be causing the swelling above my knee now  it’s severely painful if touched and moved to very much like i have half a tennis ball above my knee when standing up straight what my physio thought  that it is a sac above my knee filled with fluid causing the excrutiating pain  hnvestigate the tennis ball sized swelling above my knee cap and is just saying it is due to muscle deterioatient on any repetitive loading activities to the knee with a meniscus tear that was not treated the fat pad usually gets impinged during terminal knee extension rather than flexion like in cyclingvative treatment with ice cortisone injection and knee strengtheningweight bearing and in a cast so i didnt notice the knee pain until about 2 months later the surgeon completely opened up my knee 4 inch incision on the outside and removed a gooce stretching isometrics stretching orthodics knee braces ive tried just about everything u can also try icing the knee and do some physiotherapy i had quite severe swelling of my knee which took almost 3 4 months to subsidedllofemoral joint mobility with very sharp anterior knee pain with my patella tendon and quadricep tendon m i had another mri of my knee with my graft acl intact but showing some signal c i now still suffered from anterior knee pain but it appears to decrease with improving pat my question is if my anterior knee pain is related to inflammation of my infrapatellalem to solve as the tissues over the front of your knee and around the kneecap are stiffer than usualeople with similar problems report having anterior knee pain during the start of the sporting activity and the pain may improve once the knee is “warmed up”e pain is worse in the morning and improve when my knee is warmed up and then usually reappears again the  in fact i notice there is some swelling below my knee cap with mild increased temperature whenever i havy maltracking was very severe before i noticed my knee cap was tilted upward and lateral to the usual posnt question is why i only experience pain when my knee is in full extension particularly when i stand with my knee totally straight is post surgical constracture in the front of the knee causing your symptomsohn

i had a “simple” arthroscopy of my knee and ended up with fat pad syndromeortals are usually made close to the centre of the knee where the fat pad is as it allows the surgeon to dgs without damaging the articular cartilage of the knee jointhad to remove the entire fat behind from behind my knee because it had been shreededs on i am now currently expericing weakness in the knee giving way i am a fairly active person this can cause the front of the knee to be tight as he has said that the fat is causing my knee cap to mis track and hence my knee to dislocate2 at 950 am	
dear kylie
i have not examined your knee nor seen your scans my knee is still very swollen and painful but the thing that is bothering me the most is that when i bend my knee there is a squishing noise in my knee and it feels
the squishing sound in the knee is typical after knee scope as fluid was placed inside the knee joint dues and blood from post surgery bleeding inside the knee joint to cause this sound
you feel unwell as it the operated knee tends to be inflamed and swollen at 3 to 4 days after a knee arthroscopyatients back to my clinic at 3 to 4 days after the knee scope surgery to drain out excessive blood in the  this helps to relieve the tension in the knee and they can walk much better at 1003 pm

it is normal for the knee to swell up after arthroscopy the surgery to remove the blood from the operated knee using a needle and syringe the aspiration of the accumulated blood in the knee helps the patient to have less pain and earlier return to quadriceps function and control of the knee jointto your surgeon if aspiration of the blood in your knee may be helpful2013 at 948 pm

a course of physiotherapy to the affected knee may be useful the front of my knee is very hot to the touch i am going to suggest to my dr to drain my knee to see if that would alleviate the swelling the o ago i started exhibiting pain in the front of the knee below the knee cap the mri showed a meniscus tear on the side of the knee specifically the inside of the kneee that structurally other than the fixed tear my knee looked great address the core problem wear a strap under the knee cap and finally a cortisone shot which didn’t helankle surgery i was advised to perform a terminal knee extension exercise with a resistance band to activent doctor i saw told me might be the fat under my knee causing problem only one side of the knee near the knee cap hurts and some times after exercise i may have to rest the knee to bring down the painart of the healing process as i’m worried that my knee will not function normally without the fat pad

it all depends on how bothersome is your knee pain from the hoffa’s syndrome08 am	
hi toni
what you have is post arthroscopy knee swellinghis accumulation of blood or fluid in the operated knee usually resolves by itself over a few weeksng hoffa’s pad inflammation after 8 months of left knee pain some patients report less symptoms with knee brace i had knee pain on the front of my knee for over 2 years and after physical therapy i had prolonged swelling pain and subsequently anterior knee pain from scar formation the knee cap tends to be pulled downwards patellar bajar 7 2013 at 1033 pm	
hello doctor
my wife had a knee replacement 2 years ago and has had constant pain  my question is could the knee replacement be causing an impingement and since ys
the fat pad is usually removed at the time of a knee replacement surgery
it is very unlikely to be the cause of her knee pain patella un resurfaced and it can lead to anterior knee pain in some patients the procedure was a left knee arthroplasty i saw a couple of well know sport knee surgeons and they both said they don’t like and have very little experience scoping under the knee cap3 at 714 am
